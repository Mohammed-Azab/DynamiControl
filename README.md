# DynamiControl_PID
DynamiControl_PID is a project focused on designing and tuning PID controllers and Lead-Lag compensators (LC) for a ball stabilizer system controlled by Arduino. It involves real-time control using a ball sensor and servo motor, with MATLAB/Simulink analysis and hardware implementation for system performance enhancement.
